# code-usage-analysis - Code Usage Patterns & Architecture

## Project Overview
This scratchsheet tracks system-wide usage patterns, architectural relationships, and dependency graphs discovered during code analysis.

## Discovered Patterns
*Add patterns that reveal how components interact across the system*

## System Architecture

High-level architectural patterns and component relationships

TBD

## Core Components

Central files and modules that many others depend on

TBD

## Integration Points

Key interfaces and boundaries between subsystems

TBD

## Dependency Patterns

Common dependency structures and import patterns

TBD

## Entry Points

Main entry points and initialization sequences

TBD

## Utility Libraries

Commonly used helper functions and utilities

TBD

## Orphaned Code

Files that appear to be unused or disconnected

TBD

## Circular Dependencies

Detected circular dependency patterns

TBD


## Analysis Guidelines
*Patterns that should inform future usage analysis*

---
*This scratchsheet is automatically updated during the analysis process*
