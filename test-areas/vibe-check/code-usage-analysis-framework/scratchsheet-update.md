# Global Context Update from deploy.sh Analysis

## Discovered Patterns
- **Orphaned deployment scripts**: Found `scripts/deploy.sh` that is not integrated into any CI/CD pipeline or called by other scripts
- **Missing infrastructure**: No package.json found despite npm commands being used in deployment script
- **Template pattern**: Deployment scripts exist as templates with placeholder logic rather than implemented functionality

## Entry Points
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Manual deployment entry point accepting environment parameter (staging/production)

## Orphaned Code
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Deployment script with no automated callers or CI/CD integration

## Infrastructure Gaps
- Missing CI/CD configuration files (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- No package.json despite npm-based build/test commands
- Deployment logic not implemented beyond echo statements

## Dependency Patterns
- Scripts depend on npm ecosystem without corresponding package configuration
- Shell scripts using simple bash patterns with minimal external dependencies
