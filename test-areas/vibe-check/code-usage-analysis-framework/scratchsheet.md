# code-usage-analysis - Code Usage Patterns & Architecture

## Project Overview
This scratchsheet tracks system-wide usage patterns, architectural relationships, and dependency graphs discovered during code analysis.

## Discovered Patterns
*Add patterns that reveal how components interact across the system*

### Deployment Infrastructure Pattern
- **Template-based deployment scripts**: The project contains deployment automation templates (e.g., deploy.sh) that define standard deployment workflows but lack actual implementation
- **Environment-based deployment**: Scripts support multiple deployment environments (staging, production) with validation
- **Build-test-deploy pipeline**: Standard CI/CD pattern with sequential build, test, and deployment phases

## System Architecture

High-level architectural patterns and component relationships

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Deployment Scripts**: Located in `/scripts/` directory, containing deployment automation
- **Missing Package Management**: References to npm commands without corresponding package.json configuration

## Core Components

Central files and modules that many others depend on

TBD

## Integration Points

Key interfaces and boundaries between subsystems

### Deployment Integration Gap
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: No integration with standard CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- **Build System**: NPM commands referenced but not configured
- **Deployment Targets**: Placeholder logic for staging/production environments

## Dependency Patterns

Common dependency structures and import patterns

### External Dependencies
- **NPM**: Build and test toolchain dependency (unconfigured)
- **Bash**: Script execution environment

## Entry Points

Main entry points and initialization sequences

### Manual Entry Points
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: Manual deployment execution entry point

## Utility Libraries

Commonly used helper functions and utilities

TBD

## Orphaned Code

Files that appear to be unused or disconnected

### Deployment Scripts
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: Standalone deployment script with no automated callers or CI/CD integration
  - Contains placeholder deployment logic
  - References missing npm configuration
  - Represents incomplete deployment automation

## Circular Dependencies

Detected circular dependency patterns

TBD

## Infrastructure Gaps

### Missing Configuration
- **package.json**: Required for npm commands used in deployment scripts
- **CI/CD Configuration**: No automated deployment pipeline configuration

### Incomplete Implementation
- **Deployment Logic**: Scripts contain echo statements instead of actual deployment commands
- **Environment-specific Configuration**: No actual staging/production deployment implementation

## Analysis Guidelines
*Patterns that should inform future usage analysis*

### Deployment Script Analysis
- Check for CI/CD integration files when analyzing deployment scripts
- Verify package manager configuration when scripts use build tools
- Identify whether scripts are integrated or orphaned
- Note template vs. implemented functionality
