## Executive Summary

The codebase exhibits critical security vulnerabilities and performance issues that require immediate attention. Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, and missing input validation create significant security risks, while N+1 query patterns and resource leaks impact performance and reliability.

## Top 5 Priority Issues

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities** (src/utils/database.go:50, 56)
   - Business Impact: Complete data breach potential, regulatory compliance violations
   - Immediate risk to user data and system integrity

2. **Hardcoded JWT Secret** (src/api/user.js:39)
   - Business Impact: Authentication bypass, unauthorized access to all user accounts
   - Compromises entire user authentication system

3. **Missing Input Validation** (src/api/user.js:10, src/utils/database.go:54)
   - Business Impact: Data corruption, system instability, attack surface expansion
   - Enables various attack vectors including injection and DoS

4. **Disabled SSL Connection** (src/utils/database.go:27)
   - Business Impact: Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Violates data protection requirements and compliance standards

5. **Resource Leaks** (src/utils/database.go:65)
   - Business Impact: System crashes, increased infrastructure costs
   - Affects application stability and scalability

## Quick Wins

- **Enable SSL mode**: Single configuration change in database connection string
- **Add defer rows.Close()**: One-line fix preventing memory leaks
- **Environment variable for JWT secret**: Move hardcoded secret to config
- **Basic input validation**: Add null/empty checks for critical parameters

## Root Causes

1. **Security-by-Design Gap**: Lack of secure coding practices in database interactions and authentication
2. **Missing Development Standards**: No code review process catching basic security vulnerabilities
3. **Incomplete Implementation**: Deployment scripts with placeholder code indicate rushed development
4. **Performance Oversight**: N+1 query patterns suggest lack of database optimization awareness

## Action Plan

**Immediate (Week 1)**:
- Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities using parameterized queries
- Replace hardcoded JWT secret with environment variable
- Enable SSL mode for database connections

**Short-term (Week 2-3)**:
- Implement comprehensive input validation across all endpoints
- Add proper resource cleanup with defer statements
- Optimize N+1 query patterns with JOIN operations

**Medium-term (Month 1)**:
- Complete deployment script implementation
- Establish secure coding standards and review processes
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

**Resource Requirements**: 2-3 developers, security review, potential infrastructure changes for SSL certificates.
